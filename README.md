# Aviation Emissions Toolkit

Open-source tools and reproducible examples for estimating airline and aviation emissions using data-driven methods.  
This repository extends and repackages prior open-source research work in aviation emissions estimation.

## Background and Research Context
This toolkit builds on open-source emissions estimation work originally developed as part of my academic research in aviation systems and emissions modeling.

## Ongoing Work (2026)
This repository reflects continued research activity and public dissemination in aviation emissions estimation. Ongoing work includes:
- Modularizing emissions calculation methodologies into reusable components
- Adding reproducible examples (notebooks and scripts) that run end-to-end
- Improving documentation and usage clarity for researchers and practitioners
- Adding small demonstration datasets or instructions for obtaining publicly available data

## Repository Structure (Planned)
- `src/` – core toolkit code (Python modules)
- `examples/` – runnable notebooks/scripts demonstrating usage
- `data/` – small sample data or instructions for obtaining public datasets
- `docs/` – methodology notes and references

## Usage
Initial setup instructions and examples will be added in the `examples/` directory.  
This repository is intended to support transparent, reproducible experimentation and future research extensions.
